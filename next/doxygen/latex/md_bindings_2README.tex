This folder contains all bindings that the embedded scripts need to expose functionality from {\ttfamily vs} to the user. ~\newline
 Both module and single user scripts share the same bindings, however certain feature might be disabled in module scripts to avoid/mitigate aliasing. ~\newline


These are {\bfseries{not}} the vs-\/fltk C bindings. Those are in {\ttfamily /include/cbindings/\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} and {\ttfamily /src/cbindings/\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}}.
