- Looking for the best match which exists
- Save the path resolution to cache
- Load it based on its type:

    - MD load and store as compiled xml document
    - WASM load in memory as binary (buffer) or a script once WASM scripts are supported?.
    - LIB skip, the library will be loaded on demand
    - CNATIVE compile and save it as script. Technically it is not, but I am not going to compile it over and over and script works as a container
