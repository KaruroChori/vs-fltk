Thank you for choosing `vs`, the lightweight UI runtime.  
This page covers the basics to get started with it as a user!

## Downloading binaries

You can download the latest binaries for the supported platforms from the [releases](https://github.com/KaruroChori/vs-fltk/releases) page.  
If you wish to compile `vs` on your own, please check the [developer docs](./developers/building.md).

### Installation

## Running a `vs` application

Once installed, `vs` will be available in your system either as a desktop launcher entry or via command line.  
If installed as a native application you can just use it typing `vs` in the terminal.  
If you installed it as a flatpak, `flatpak run com.karurochari.vs`.

Running `vs` via command lines allows you to specify custom environment variables or to run some of its subcommands without navigating the embedded UI.  
The rest of the document will cover this.
