Collection of format configs for this project.  
As a developer you should not be too concerned about them, they will be picked up by CI.

- [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for C/C++
- [`biome`](https://biomejs.dev/) for TS/TSX/JSON
- [`xmllint`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2) for XML

Missing (I need to check what vscode is using for them right now maybe):

- Swift
- yml
- toml
- md
